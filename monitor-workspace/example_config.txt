# Example configuration for Hyprland with monitor-workspace plugin
# Add this to your hyprland.conf file:

# Load the plugin
plugin = /path/to/your/monitor-workspace.so

# Configure workspace layouts for different monitor counts
plugin {
    monitor_workspace {
        # Single monitor: all workspaces on one monitor
        layout_1_monitors = m1:1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10

        # Dual monitor: alternating workspaces
        layout_2_monitors = m1:2,4,6,8,10;m2:1,3,5,7,9

        # Triple monitor: distributed workspaces
        layout_3_monitors = m1:7,8,9,10;m2:1,2,3;m3:4,5,6

        # Four monitors example
        layout_4_monitors = m1:1,5,9;m2:2,6,10;m3:3,7;m4:4,8
    }
}

# Notes:
# - m1 is the leftmost monitor (lowest X position)
# - m2 is the second monitor from the left
# - m3 is the third monitor from the left
# - Monitors are sorted by X position, then Y if X is equal
# - Each monitor automatically switches to its first workspace when layout is applied
# - Workspaces are created if they don't exist
# - Existing workspaces are moved to their assigned monitors
